## Go Simple Processor

### Overview
This project defines the design and instruction set for a simple 16 bit parallel
processor whose purpose is to handle the processing of one request from an
external source and resulting in one response back to the external source.

It is ideal for the latest cloud-based web-service architectures like AWS Lambda
Functions or Azure Functions that execute a function for each web request that is
received.  These architectures don't require the overhead of an operating system
running on a traditional microprocessor.

This project will eventually provide a Go based simulator for the simple processor.
